# Python-script-serial-comm
Python script to simulate serial communication

## üìå Overview
This project simulates a **hardware device communicating over a UART (serial) connection**, verifies received data, and checks for expected responses. It is designed for verification engineers who want to **test serial communication logic** without requiring real hardware.

## Step 1: Install Required Python Libraries

Before you begin, install the required Python libraries to simulate serial communication and manage configuration files easily.

Run the following command in your terminal:

pip install pyserial pyyaml

Libraries Used:

pyserial: A Python library to simulate serial communication.

pyyaml: A library to handle test configurations in a YAML format, making it easier to edit and manage.

## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Serial Port on macOS

Since we are simulating hardware, we will create a pair of virtual serial ports using socat. This will allow two Python scripts to communicate as if they were connected to actual hardware.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install socat

Install socat on macOS using Homebrew:

brew install socat

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Virtual Serial Ports

After installing socat, run the following command in your terminal to create two virtual serial ports:

socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0

This command will generate two virtual serial ports. The output will look similar to this:

2024/02/10 12:34:56 socat[12345] N PTY is /dev/ttys004
2024/02/10 12:34:56 socat[12345] N PTY is /dev/ttys005

3Ô∏è‚É£ Take Note of the Virtual Ports

Take note of the two virtual serial devices created by socat (e.g., /dev/ttys004 and /dev/ttys005).

One port will be used by the mock hardware script.
The other port will be used by the test script to simulate communication.

## üöÄ Running the Project

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Mock Hardware

python mock_hardware.py

(Simulates a device sending data every 2 seconds.)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Test Runner

python test_runner.py

(Listens for data and verifies expected responses.)

## Expected Output
‚úÖ PASS - Check Device Version (Response: v1.2.3)

‚úÖ PASS - Test LED Toggle (Response: OK)

‚úÖ PASS - Read Temperature Sensor (Response: 25.4C)

‚úÖ PASS - Invalid Command (Response: ERROR)

=== TEST RESULTS ===
4 tests run, 4 passed, 0 failed.
